Dear Hiring Manager at Equinor,

I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Electronic System Design and Innovation at NTNU. My passion for coding has led me to explore a internships on the development and automatio\
n of engineering tasks. I aspire to create solutions that optimize analytics of sensor data, identify optimal placement of sensors, and develop new sensor technologies. I believe that \
machine learning will play a crucial role in achieving these goals, and I am eager to combine these topics in my education in the coming years.

I enjoy problem-solving and have demonstrated my skills in the Norwegian IT Olympiad, where I was a finalist in 2020. I also participated in the Abel contest, where I secured the 30th \
position in Norway, just one point away from reaching the Norwegian final.

Equinor is a company that resonates with my values and aspirations. I am particularly drawn to their long-standing experience in advanced technology and their commitment to being a wor\
ld leader in renewable energy infrastructure while continuing to provide the world’s cleanest natural gas. A summer internship with Equinor would be an excellent opportunity for me, an\
d I believe that a future position within the company would be an ideal job for me. I am excited about the prospect of being part of Equinor’s journey.

Looking forward to hearing from you.


Best Regards

Peder I. Dahl
